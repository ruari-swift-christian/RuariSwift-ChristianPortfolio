# [PROJECT 1: Senior Project: KNN Analytics for AL NL playoff teams in 2019](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/senior_project/blob/main/Senior-Project.pdf)
#Show Connections with Division Champs and League(American Or National League) with Average Player and Runs Scored Through KNN and Decision Tree Classification Algorithms. show which playoff team had the best offensive output for the budget
#Showed Linear Regression Models to try and show a linear relationship between Playoffs and Wins, Runs Scored, and average player salary in the FIRST MODEL #SECOND model find a linear relationship betweene playoffs and av. player salary and
runs scored

# [PROJECT 2: COVID-19 Testing, Vaccination, Cases, Cases by Age Group, Deaths Stats for Eech US State and a Exploratory ANalysis](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/covid-US-states-project/new/main?readme=1)
# PROJECT Goals: 
#First Use Linear Regression To Find A Linear Relationship between Total Population and Cases and Total Population.
#Secondly, Do a Principal Component Analysis of each variable to see the importance of each one and the distribution of Variance
#Thirdly, Test out Clustering methods via Kmeans as well as a Principal Component bar graph for each component.
#DATA VISUALIZATION:
#Create Scatterplot Matrix to see aboutth e relationship between 6 variables: Total Covid-19 Tests, Total Covid-19 Cases, total people vaccinated in the entire State
# Continued.. Total State Population, Total negative tests, total Positive Tests.
#Next a Correlation Plot for all 6 variables: there was a linear relationship and correlation between cases, total vaccinated, and total state population
#make a added variable Plot
#create a Animated KMeans Plot
