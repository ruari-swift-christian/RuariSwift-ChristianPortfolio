# [PROJECT 1: Senior Project: KNN Analytics for AL NL playoff teams in 2019](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/senior_project/blob/main/Senior-Project.pdf)
#Show Connections with Division Champs and League(American Or National League) with Average Player and Runs Scored Through KNN and Decision Tree Classification Algorithms. show which playoff team had the best offensive output for the budget
#Showed Linear Regression Models to try and show a linear relationship between Playoffs and Wins, Runs Scored, and average player salary in the FIRST MODEL #SECOND model find a linear relationship betweene playoffs and av. player salary and
runs scored

# [PROJECT 2: COVID-19 Testing, Vaccination, Cases, Cases by Age Group, Deaths Stats for Eech US State and a Exploratory ANalysis](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/covid-US-states-project/new/main?readme=1)
# PROJECT Goals: 
#First Use Linear Regression To Find A Linear Relationship between Total Population and Cases and Total Population.
#Secondly, Do a Principal Component Analysis of each variable to see the importance of each one and the distribution of Variance
#Thirdly, Test out Clustering methods via Kmeans as well as a Principal Component bar graph for each component.
#DATA VISUALIZATION:
#Create Scatterplot Matrix to see aboutth e relationship between 6 variables: Total Covid-19 Tests, Total Covid-19 Cases, total people vaccinated in the entire State
# Continued.. Total State Population, Total negative tests, total Positive Tests.
#Next a Correlation Plot for all 6 variables: there was a linear relationship and correlation between cases, total vaccinated, and total state population
#make a added variable Plot
#create a Animated KMeans Plot


# Covid Month By Month Data from March 2020 to April 2021 in North Carolina animated includign Choroplethic Maps of Covid cases and people vaccinated
# per 100,000 Residents. [rpubs](https://rpubs.com/rswift/762551) 

#[Covid Project in Python Using Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/covid-US-states-project/blob/main/Covid%20Project.ipynb)
Fitted linear regression graphs aswell as a kmeans  graph of each cluster 1-5

#[Covid US States Project in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ruari.swift.christian#!/vizhome/Coviddata_16204214116870/Dashboard1)
Choroplethic Map of state population percentage out of total state population. other choroplethic maps of total cases recovered in each US State, Total Negative tests,
and total Covid-19 cases over the age of 65

# PROJECT 3 : ISIS Foreign Fighter Data in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ruari.swift.christian#!/vizhome/ISISForeignFighterdata/GlobalISISforeignFighterData)
Goal: Global Choroplethic Map out the total number of reported foreign fighters who joined ISIS in each country and each continent. show bar graph of foreign fighter per a million
citizens in each Western European Country

# [Pie Chart of total percentile distribution of foreign fighters in Africa and Europe](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ruari.swift.christian#!/vizhome/ISISForeignFighterdata/ISISfighterPieChartsAfricaEurope)

# [PROJECT 4: Leaflet Map showing all ISIS Oil Facilities and Pie Charts of ISIS Finances](https://rpubs.com/rswift/768328)

Goal: Show a Interactive Satellite Map of all ISIS oil fields/Oil Refineries in Syria and Iraq usingthe leaflet R package. Show Smuggling Routes of ISIS oil in Turkey


# [PROJECT 5: TIME SERIES PLOT OF COVID DEATHS IN EUROPE MARCH TO MAY 2021 IN PYTHON](https://github.com/ruari-swift-christian/covid-US-states-project/blob/main/europe%20covid%20cases%20march%20to%20may%202021.ipynb)
Goal: Show A Trended and de trended Time Series Plot of Covid Deaths each Day in Europe from March 2021 to May 12th 2021
